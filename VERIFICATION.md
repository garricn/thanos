# Linting and Formatting Verification

This document logs the output of the linting and formatting commands to verify that the setup is working correctly.

## Linting Verification

Command: `npm run lint:all`

Output:
```
> thanos@0.0.0 lint:all
> nx run-many -t lint --projects=web,api,web-e2e,api-e2e,api-tests

   ✔  nx run web:lint  [existing outputs match the cache left as is]
   ✔  nx run web-e2e:lint  [existing outputs match the cache left as is]
   ✔  nx run api-e2e:lint  [existing outputs match the cache left as is]
   ✔  nx run api:lint (4s)
   ✔  nx run api-tests:lint (4s)

 NX   Successfully ran target lint for 5 projects (4s)

Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 3 out of 5 tasks.
```

Result: All projects passed linting successfully. No errors were found.

## Formatting Verification

Command: `npm run format`

Output:
```
> thanos@0.0.0 format
> nx format:write

cypress.config.ts
apps/api/tests/eslint.config.mjs
vite.config.ts
```

Result: Formatting was applied to the files listed above. No errors were reported.
